This repository contains the Atlas documentation hosted on Cloudflare Pages using Material for MkDocs.

**Want to contribute?** Please check out the [Atlas Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.atlasos.net/contributions) for more information.

## How do I contribute?

As MkDocs Material uses Python, you must install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) alongside `pip` before continuing.

1. Once you've cloned the repository, `cd` into it using a shell
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies
1. If you're on Windows, run `locally-host.cmd` to host the documentation preview
    - If you're on another OS, just run `mkdocs serve`
    - The `locally-host.cmd` script is only for convenience

You can now make all your changes and view them live!
