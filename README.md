# AtlasOS Documentation

Atlas documentation hosted on GitHub Pages using Material for MkDocs.

Here you can help Atlas with documentation, for now we do not have translation capabilities but they will be added in the future.

## How to contribute

We recommend for development purposes that you use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with [Emojis](https://gitmoji.dev/), you can also use [Angular's Conventional Commits Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

We also recommend that you make a preview build on your own machine for our documentation before you commit, just so that there is no issues with the pull request.

Please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## How to make a preview build

As MkDocs uses Python, you will need to have Python and pip installed, we recommend using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install these but you can also install via [Python's website](https://www.python.org/).

Material for MkDocs has already made a page which you can use for Installation of Material for MkDocs [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

Depending if you installed it locally or via a virtual envioronment, there is already a guide on previewing [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#previewing-as-you-write)
