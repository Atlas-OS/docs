# Welcome to the AtlasOS docs contributing guide

Thank you for being invested in helping out AtlasOS and our documentation. This is amazingly useful to us and we appreciate it a lot!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## New to contributing?

If you are new to contributing to open source projects, we recommend reading the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) on how to get started.

## Getting Started

There is 6 easy steps on how to get started with contributing to AtlasOS documentation. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.atlasos.net).

1. Fork the repository
2. Write your changes
3. Commit your changes, if you don't know how to commit your changes to our standard, check [here]() for more information.
4. Push your changes
5. Open a pull request
6. Fill out the pull request template, failure to do so may result in your pull request being closed.

## How to use Markdown and MkDocs

We use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for our documentation. If you are new to Markdown, we recommend reading the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to get started.

We also use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build our documentation. If you are new to MkDocs, we recommend reading the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to get started.

The theme we use for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). If you are new to Material for MkDocs, we recommend reading the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to get started. You can find lots of useful information on styling, and how to use MkDocs to your best.

We use the [Insiders edition of Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/), so do not worry about formatting or feature limitations when creating documentation. Keep in mind that you'll need your own copy of Material for MkDocs Insiders to build and preview the documentation locally with the right formatting and features support.

## Committing to our standards

We have a standard for how we want our commits to look like. This is to keep our commits clean and easy to read. If you do not follow our commit standard, your pull request may be closed.

We make our commit standards this specific way so that us maintainers can understand what each commit is doing. We also make our commit standards this specific way so that we can easily revert commits if we need to. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) also states that these types of commits are easier to use for versioning.

### Commit message

For example, if you were to commit a new file, you would use the following commit message:

```text
feat: 📝 add {file name}
```

Otherwise, if you were fixing a bug you have made or a bug you have noticed, you would use the following commit message:

```text
fix: 🐛 {bug}
```

For more information on our commit standards, we use [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to make our commits easier to read. We also use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to make our commits easier to understand. You can also take a peak at [Angular's Conventional Commits](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/68a6a07/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) for more help.

## Issues

If you find any issues with our documentation, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/docs/issues/new). Please fill issues out with utmost detail and preferably images too so we can understand where we went wrong or so contributors can make a pull request to fix the issue.
