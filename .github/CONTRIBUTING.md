## How to use Markdown and MkDocs

We use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for our documentation. If you are new to Markdown, we recommend reading the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to get started.

We also use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build our documentation. If you are new to MkDocs, we recommend reading the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to get started.

The theme we use for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). If you are new to Material for MkDocs, we recommend reading the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to get started. You can find lots of useful information on styling, and how to use MkDocs to your best.

## Issues

If you find any issues with our documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/docs/issues/new). Please fill issues out with utmost detail and preferably images too so we can understand where we went wrong or so contributors can make a pull request to fix the issue.
