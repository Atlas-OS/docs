# Install NVIDIA Driver

We recommend using NVCleanstall, as it is a GUI app alternative to the manual method of stripping the drivers.

## Driver Installation

- Download [NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall).
- Open the application and click ``Next``.
- Make sure that only ``Display Driver`` is checked and click ``Next``.
- After the driver downloaded tick the following installation tweaks:
    - Disable Installer Telemetry & Advertising
    - Perform a Clean Installation
    - Disable Multiplane Overlay (MPO)
    - Show Expert Tweaks
        - Disable Driver Telemetry
    - Use method compatible with Easy-Anti-Cheat
    - Automatically accept the "driver unsinged" warning
- Click ``Install`` and continue with the NVIDIA driver installation as usual.
