You can either install your drivers from [Intels official website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/80939/graphics.html#211969) if you have an Intel graphics card. Use [Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO)]((https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin/)) or another driver installer as an alternative.
