Windows Settings is a folder on AtlasOS that lets you change the most common settings when you set up AtlasOS. To change some of these, you may need to use the "Activation" file to activate Windows.

All of the configuration files are located in the `3. Configuration/3. Windows Settings` folder. In your Atlas folder on your Desktop. If you have managed to misplace this folder you can download it via our [GitHub](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/main/src/Executables/Atlas) or find it in `C:/Users/default/Desktop/`.

When you run these files, you will go straight to the Windows Settings page for the setting you want to configure.

## :material-lock-open-outline: Activation

This file will take you to the page in Windows Settings for Activation. Before you can change some of the other settings, you will need to activate Windows.

Activation is a one-time thing that you won't have to do again. We recommend activating Windows because it gives you more customization features and gets rid of the "Activate Windows" watermark in the bottom right corner.

!!! warning "AtlasOS is not pre-activated"
    AtlasOS is **not** a pre-activated version of Windows. If you want to run AtlasOS legally, you need to have your own Windows license. Before you buy a Windows 10 Pro license, make sure the seller is real and the key is real, no matter where you buy it.
