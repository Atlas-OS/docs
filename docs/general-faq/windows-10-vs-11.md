# :material-alert-decagram-outline: Windows 11 is Strongly Recommended for AtlasOS

When choosing which Windows version to use as a base for AtlasOS, **Windows 11 is the strongly recommended and preferred choice.** While Windows 10 is currently supported, its use is discouraged due to its upcoming end of support.

## :material-calendar-remove: Windows 10 End of Support (October 14, 2025)

Microsoft's official support for Windows 10 is scheduled to end on **October 14, 2025**. After this date, Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security updates, non-security fixes, or technical support from Microsoft.

Running an operating system without security updates poses a significant security risk.

## :material-dev-to: Atlas Development Focus & Future Support

AtlasOS development prioritizes compatibility and optimization for the **latest supported Windows versions**, which is currently Windows 11.

*   **Primary Focus:** Windows 11 receives the primary focus for development, testing, and new features.
*   **Secondary Support for Windows 10:** While Windows 10 is supported for now, it is considered secondary.
*   **End of Atlas Support for Win10:** AtlasOS will **cease support for Windows 10** in alignment with Microsoft's end-of-life date (October 14, 2025). Future Atlas releases beyond this date may not be compatible with or tested on Windows 10.

## :material-check-decagram-outline: Conclusion: Use Windows 11

Using Windows 11 as the base for your AtlasOS installation is crucial for:

*   Receiving ongoing security updates from Microsoft.
*   Ensuring the best compatibility and performance with current and future AtlasOS releases.
*   Maintaining a secure and stable system.

We strongly advise against new installations using Windows 10.
