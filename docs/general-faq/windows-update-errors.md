This issue is on Microsoft's end with the update [KB5034441 for Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5034441-windows-recovery-environment-update-for-windows-10-version-21h2-and-22h2-january-9-2024-62c04204-aaa5-4fee-a02a-2fdea17075a8). Try the two fixes listed below and retry updates:

1. **Ensure that you have adequate free storage**
    
    You should have at least 1GB of free storage on your Windows drive. If you have little free storage after reinstalling Windows, you likely haven't removed the backup of your previous Windows installation. See [Your old Windows installation](../getting-started/installation.md#your-old-windows-installation) for more information.

1. **Enable Windows Recovery**    
    1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**
    1. Type in `reagentc /enable` and press ++enter++
    1. Restart your computer

??? question "Still having problems?"

    If the fixes above did not work, you can either:

    1. Follow [Microsoft's guidance](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5028997-instructions-to-manually-resize-your-partition-to-install-the-winre-update-400faa27-9343-461c-ada9-24c8229763bf)
    1. Pause Windows Updates to bypass (not recommended)
    1. Reinstall Windows using a USB flash drive and delete all partitions on your Windows drive. Be careful, as this permanently deletes the data on your disk!

## :material-restore-alert: General errors

On Atlas v0.3.2, specific cumulative updates that attempt to update the **Windows Backup** and **Get Started** apps in Windows fail. For the next release of Atlas, there will not be any errors with updates, which includes fixing it for users upgrading from v0.3.2.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**, and enter the commands below in order:

    ```
    dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
    sfc /scannow
    ```

    It is expected that the commands will take a while to complete. The first command will likely error with **'The source files could not be found,'** but you can safely ignore this.

1. Restart your computer

1. Attempt to update Windows again
