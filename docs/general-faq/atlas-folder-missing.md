# :material-folder-question: How do I get the Atlas configuration folder back?

**If you deleted the Atlas configuration folder shortcut on your desktop, you can find it here: `C:\Windows\AtlasDesktop`.**

If you wish to have the folder on your desktop, you should right-click on the folder and create a shortcut.

You can download the **.zip** archive below, extract it, and place the `AtlasDesktop` folder in `C:\Windows`. The link below updates upon each new Atlas release.
