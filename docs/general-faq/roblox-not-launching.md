# :simple-roblox: Why is Roblox not launching?

**Some users may experience Roblox not launching on Atlas due to various factors.**

Follow the methods below to fix the problem.

1. Change time and date

    - Open the Start Menu, search for `Date & time settings` and toggle `Set the time automatically` off.
    
    - Click on `Change` and add one day to the date setting.

    - After one day, you can re-enable the automatic time and date setting.

2. Enable TPM and Secure Boot

    - To enable **TPM 2.0** and **Secure Boot**, you need to access the BIOS of your computer and enable **TPM 2.0** (or **Trusted Platform Module**) and **Secure Boot**. Refer to your motherboard's manual if you don't know how to access your BIOS.

3. Enable UAC

    - Open the Control Panel, search for `Change User Account Control settings` and set it to either Level 1, 2 or 3. **If UAC was disabled (set to Level 0), reinstall Roblox after enabling it.**
