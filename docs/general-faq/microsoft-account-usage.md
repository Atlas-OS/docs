# :material-account-circle-outline: Using Your Microsoft Account with AtlasOS

A common question is whether you can or should use your Microsoft account with AtlasOS. Here's the breakdown:

## :material-store: Microsoft Store and Apps

**Yes, you can sign in with your Microsoft account within the Microsoft Store** or within specific applications (like the Xbox app) that require it.

This allows you to:

*   Install apps you own.
*   Access subscriptions linked to your account (like Game Pass).
*   Sync progress in certain games or apps.

Signing into the Store or individual apps does **not** require you to use a Microsoft account for your main Windows login.

## :material-account-off-outline: Windows User Account (Login)

While you *can* technically use a Microsoft account to sign in to Windows itself on AtlasOS, **we strongly recommend using a local account instead for privacy reasons.**

*   **Why a local account?** AtlasOS aims to minimize data collection and telemetry sent to Microsoft. Using a local account is a key step in achieving this, as it avoids directly linking your device usage and diagnostics to your personal Microsoft account profile. Microsoft accounts inherently involve more data synchronization and potential tracking compared to offline, local accounts.
*   **Functionality:** You can still access most Windows features and install software using a local account. Signing into specific apps (like the Store, as mentioned above) is separate from your main Windows login.

**In summary:** Feel free to use your Microsoft account where needed *within* apps like the Microsoft Store, but stick to a local account for your main Windows user profile to align with our privacy-focused goals.
