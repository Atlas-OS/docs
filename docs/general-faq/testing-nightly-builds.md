# :material-test-tube: How can I test pre-release builds of AtlasOS?

**If you wish to take part in testing nightly, pre-release development builds, you can do so by adding the 'Development' Discord role on our Discord server.**

---

We often post announcements to the development Discord role when we need help testing new pre-release builds, small polls, and development updates. If interested, you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.atlasos.net/) and apply the development role to your profile.

These builds are different from the ones automatically built on our GitHub. Official development builds posted on our Discord are ready to be tested for feedback.

See ['Contributing to the Atlas Playbook'](../contributing/playbook.md) for more information on testing. :smile:
