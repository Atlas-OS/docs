# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I update AtlasOS to the latest version?

**If you're running a version of Atlas before v0.3.0, you can NOT update.**

We will always recommend users wanting to update to the latest version of Atlas clean install (to avoid issues). If you're running v0.3.0 and want to update to a newer release, you can "dirty update" if you wish - but it may cause issues.
