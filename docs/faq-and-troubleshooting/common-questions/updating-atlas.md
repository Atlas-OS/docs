# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I update AtlasOS to the latest version?

**If you're running an Atlas Playbook version of 0.2.0 or below, you cannot update your Atlas or Windows version. Additionally, Atlas versions under 0.4.0 require a full reinstall to update to the latest Atlas version.** 

The latest versions of Atlas support cumulative Windows Updates, which include security and quality patches for Windows.

## What should I do on an older version?

Many changes that older Atlas versions made were irreversible, meaning that updating to the latest version of Atlas does not revert those changes. This makes for an unsupported configuration and causes stability issues.

Previous versions of Atlas [have security concerns](atlas-and-security.md#legacy-versions-of-atlas), which only increase over time due to a lack of Windows Updates. These versions of Atlas are no longer supported, lack features, and lack many bug fixes.
