# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I update AtlasOS to the latest version?

**If you're running an Atlas Playbook version v0.2.0 or below, you can not update Atlas or Windows version.** The latest versions of Atlas support cumulative Windows Updates, which include security and quality patches for Windows.

## What should I do on an older version?

Many changes that older Atlas versions made were irreversible, meaning that updating to the latest version of Atlas does not revert those changes. This makes for an unsupported configuration and causes stability issues.

Previous versions of Atlas [have security concerns](atlas-and-security.md#legacy-versions-of-atlas), which only increase over time due to a lack of Windows Updates. These versions of Atlas are no longer supported, lack features, and lack many bug fixes.
