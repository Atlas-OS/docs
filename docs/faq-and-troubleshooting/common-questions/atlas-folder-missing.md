# :material-folder-question: How to fix Atlas folder missing?

**If there is not a shortcut for the folder on your desktop, you can find it here: `C:/Windows/AtlasDesktop`.**

If you wish to have the folder on your desktop, instead of moving the main folder we recommend you create a shortcut and place it on your desktop.
