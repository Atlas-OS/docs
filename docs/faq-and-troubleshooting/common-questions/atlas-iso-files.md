# :material-disc: Where is the Atlas ISO file?

**Atlas doesn't have an ISO file. It uses AME Wizard to modify Windows on a new live installation, applying configurations like an ISO file.**

Distributing ISO files violates Microsoft's End-User License Agreement (EULA) and poses safety risks due to uncertainty about the contents. To ensure compliance and safety, we use AME Wizard and release updates directly from our GitHub repository. We also include a checksum with each release so you can verify the integrity of your download.
