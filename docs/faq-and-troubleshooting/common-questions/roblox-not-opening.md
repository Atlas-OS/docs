# :simple-roblox: Why is Roblox not opening?

**Some users may experience Roblox not opening on Atlas due to various factors.**

Follow the methods below to fix the problem.

1. Enable TPM and Secure Boot

    - To enable **TPM 2.0** and **Secure Boot**, you need to access the BIOS of your computer and enable **TPM 2.0** (or **Trusted Platform Module**) and **Secure Boot**. Refer to your motherboard's manual if you don't know how to access your BIOS.

2. Enable UAC

    - Open the Control Panel, search for `Change User Account Control settings` and set it to either Level 1, 2 or 3. **If UAC was disabled (set to Level 0), reinstall Roblox after enabling it.**

3. Create a new Local Account

    - Navigate to the following section in the "Settings" app to create a new local account:

        - **:material-microsoft: Windows 11**

            `Accounts > Other users > Add other user`

        - **:material-microsoft-windows: Windows 10**

            `Accounts > Family & other users > Add someone else to this PC`

    - Sign out of your current account and log into the newly created one.

    - Transfer all your data (Desktop, Downloads, etc.) from the old user account to the new one.

    - Install Roblox as you normally would.

    - After ensuring all your data has been successfully transferred, you may delete the old user account.

    !!! warning

        Be sure to verify that all your important data has been moved before deleting the old account.
