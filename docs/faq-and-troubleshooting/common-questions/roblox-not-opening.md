**You may be missing TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot. You can also make a new user account and move everything over.**

Follow the methods below to fix the problem.

=== "Method 1: Enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot"

    !!! success ""

        If you're using Windows 11, you've already got TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot turned on (unless you bypassed). If that's the case, try [Method 2](#__tabbed_1_2).

    To enable **TPM 2.0** and **Secure Boot**, you need to access the BIOS of your computer and enable **TPM 2.0** (or **Trusted Platform Module**) and **Secure Boot**.

    Refer to your motherboard's manual if you don't know how to access your BIOS.

=== "Method 2: Creating a New Local Account"

    1. Navigate to the following section in the "Settings" app to create a new local account:

       Windows 10: `Accounts > Family & other users > Add someone else to this PC`
    
       Windows 11: `Accounts > Other users > Add other user`

    1. Sign out of your current account and log into the newly created one.

    1. Transfer all your data (Desktop, Downloads, etc.) from the old user account to the new one.

    1. Install Roblox as you normally would.

    1. After ensuring all your data has been successfully transferred, you may delete the old user account.

    !!! warning

        Be sure to verify that all your important data has been moved before deleting the old account.
