**iTunes not recognising your Apple device is a driver issue. Download Apple USB Drivers to fix this issue.**

If you're using Atlas and not using Automatic Driver Installation, you will need to install the Apple USB driver yourself.

To fix this issue:

1. Download the latest Apple USB drivers from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Apple%2C%20Inc.%20-%20USBDevice)

2. Extract (use 7-Zip or Explorer, ignore any errors/warnings) the zipped driver

3. **Right-click** on the `.inf` file :material-arrow-right: **Install**

Alternatively, use [Microsoft PC Manager](https://pcmanager-en.microsoft.com/) to interact with the core of Windows Update to install the Apple USB drivers, and bypass Atlas' Windows Update driver blocks.

If you're experiencing significant issues with drivers, you can also enable Automatic Driver Installation from the Atlas folder.
