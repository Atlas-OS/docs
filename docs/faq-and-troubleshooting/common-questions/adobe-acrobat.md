# :simple-adobe: How to fix Adobe Acrobat not installing?

**Printing must be enabled (via the Atlas folder) to install Adobe Acrobat correctly**

This can be found in the Atlas folder, under configuration.

This is because Adobe installs the "Adobe PDF" printer on your system. Adobe PDF is a printer driver that saves documents in a format called Adobe PDF.
