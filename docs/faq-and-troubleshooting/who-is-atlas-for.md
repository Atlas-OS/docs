# :material-head-check: Who is Atlas designed for?

**We designed Atlas for any enthusiast looking to improve Windows' privacy, performance, and ease of use.**

---

Atlas' goal is to make a stable and easy-to-use Windows modification that *almost everyone* can use, with a strong focus on compatibility and usability.

However, with that in mind, we wouldn't recommend installing Atlas if:

- You're installing it on a computer you do not wholly own
- You aren't willing to perform potential Windows troubleshooting
- You aren't willing to reinstall Windows

### New releases

Remember that Atlas continuously improves by fixing bugs and adding more features with each new version, meaning the likelihood of issues will continually decrease.

We hope that Atlas helps you get more out of Windows! :smile:
