# :material-head-check: Who is Atlas designed for?

**Atlas is for any enthusiast looking to improve the privacy, performance and ease of use of their Windows installation.**

We're on a mission to make a modification which *mostly* everyone can use, with the least amount of drawbacks.

Although Atlas aims for the best compatibility, performance and quality-of-life fixes possible, you may have to do some troubleshooting with certain Atlas configurations - which isn't always suitable for everyone.
