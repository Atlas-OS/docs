# :material-test-tube: How can I test pre-release builds of AtlasOS?

**If you wish to take part in testing nightly, pre-release dev builds, you can do so by adding the "Development" Discord role to your profile.**

We love it when people want to help contribute to Atlas. If you don't know how to work with AME Wizard or aren't that technically minded when it comes to registry. This might be something you can help to contribute to.

We often post announcements to the "Development" Discord role when we need help testing new pre-release builds which are close to public releases. If you're interested, you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.atlasos.net/) and apply the "Development" role to your profile.
