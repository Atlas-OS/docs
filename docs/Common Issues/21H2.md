# 21H2

??? bug "FACEIT is not working correctly"
    This seems like an ongoing issue. Sometimes closing it fully and opening it back up again fixes it, but if it doesn't you can always update to 22H2.
  
??? bug "Warzone / Modern Warfare 2 not launching"
    This is a common issue with many Atlas users with a solution made already [here](../../Guides/COD%20MW%20WZ2%20fix.md).

??? bug "Fortnite is asking for DirectX 12 even though I have it"
    This issue is well known across Atlas, there is no fix except updating to Atlas 22H2 or above. You can download that [here](https://atlasos.net/downloads).
