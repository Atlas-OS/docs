## What is Atlas?

Atlas is a modified version of Windows which removes all the negative drawbacks of Windows, which adversely affect gaming performance. We are a transparent and open source project striving for equal rights for players whether you are running a low-end, or a high-end PC.

While keeping our main focus on performance, we are also a great option to reduce system latency, network latency, input lag, and keep your system private.
