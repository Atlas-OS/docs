## :material-head-question-outline: What is Atlas?

Atlas is a open source, and transparent project, that modifies Windows, and removes all of the negative drawbacks that affect gaming performance.

We are a great option for reducing system latency, network latency, input lag, and keeping your system private while still keeping our focus on performance.
