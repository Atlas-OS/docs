## :material-head-question-outline: What is Atlas?

Atlas is a open source, and transparent project, that modifies Windows, and removes all of the negative drawbacks that affect gaming performance.

We are a great option for reducing system latency, network latency, input lag, and keeping your system private while still keeping our focus on performance.

Here are some resources to help you with your Atlas journey:

* [Getting started](/Getting%20started/Installation/)
* [Troubleshooting](/Troubleshooting/Removed%20features/)
* [FAQ](/FAQ/Installation/)
