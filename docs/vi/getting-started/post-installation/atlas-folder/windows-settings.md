# Windows Settings

Windows Settings is a folder on Atlas that lets you change the most common settings when you set up Atlas. For some of these, you may need to use the "Activation" file and activate Windows.

All of the configuration files listed here are located in the `3. Configuration/3. Windows Settings` folder. In the Atlas folder which is on the Desktop. If you deleted the folder, check out [our guide to restore the Atlas folder](../../../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/atlas-folder-missing.md).

When you run these files, you will go straight to the Windows Settings page for the setting you want to configure.

## :material-lock-open-outline: Activation

This file will take you to the page in Windows Settings for Activation. Before you can change some of the other settings, you will need to activate Windows.

Activation is a one-time thing that you will not have to do again. We recommend activating Windows because it gives you more customization features and gets rid of the "Activate Windows" watermark in the bottom right corner.

!!! warning "Atlas is not pre-activated"
    Atlas is **not** a pre-activated version of Windows. If you want to run Atlas legally, you need to have your own Windows license. Before you buy a Windows (Pro OR Home) license, make sure the seller is trusted and the key is legitimate, no matter where you buy it.
