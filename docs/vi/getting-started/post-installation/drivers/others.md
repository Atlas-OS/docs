When it comes to other drives, which includes Bluetooth, Scanners, Printer drivers we recommend to **download directly from the OEM of the device,** or use SDIO as a back up option.

Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO) scans your device for connected and wireless devices which don't have drivers.

## :material-screwdriver: Snappy Driver Installer Origin

Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO) can help you finding drivers which are compatible with your hardware. SDIO scans your system for missing or outdated drivers and installs the most up-to-date ones for you.

1. Visit [their website](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin) and download the installer under the "Download Application" section.
2. Extract the .zip file and open the ``x64`` file. Follow the steps in the wizard.
    * The x64 build is the only one that works with Atlas.
    * When prompted, select "Download indexes only". Otherwise, you'll download useless drivers.
3. Wait for SDIO to download the indexes.
4. Select drivers to install and press "Install" on the left.
