# Why is AME Wizard being detected as a virus?

**AME Wizard can be falsely flagged as a virus when a new version is published. To avoid it being detected, add it to your Windows Defender exclusions list.**

Windows Security may automatically flag AME Wizard as malicious when trying to run it, or may even delete it before running it.

To avoid these problems you can temporarily disable **Real Time Protection** or follow [AME's Security Exceptions Documentation (recommended)](https://docs.ameliorated.io/guides/security-exceptions.html).
