# How do I return to Windows after installing AtlasOS?

**You'll need to reinstall Windows to revert Atlas' modification.**

This is required because our installation instructions on our documentation guide you to reinstall Windows (deleting your previous install), and then, install Atlas.

If you need help reinstalling Windows, you can use Google, YouTube or follow our guide on how to install Atlas, but skip out running AME Wizard.

This will get you to a completely stock Windows installation.
