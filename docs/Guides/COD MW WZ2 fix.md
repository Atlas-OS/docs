## FAQ
- “Still getting version error, how to fix?”: Try the opposite game client. As an example, if using Battle.net, try using Steam.
- “My error says I am on Windows 8, what do I do?”: Go into the local files of the game, find the Call Of Duty executable (cod.exe). Right click and Properties. Then go to compatibility and make sure the option where you pick Windows 8 is unchecked. Sometimes it may be checked automatically
