# :material-help-box-multiple: How to report issues when testing

This page tells you how to report any issues you find [when testing](what-to-test.md).

## :material-script-text: AME Wizard logs

Before reporting, we would find it useful if you could skim through your AME Wizard logs (located in `C:\ProgramData\AME\Logs`) to look for the following:

- The `Output.txt` from the latest Playbook
    - Check if there are any errors in the scripts
    - If there are any logical errors in the scripts
- The `Log.yml`
    - Check if there are any errors from AME Wizard

If you find anything, include that in your report. However, **post all logs when reporting bugs so we can also look through them.** No personally identifiable information is contained in these, except from your Windows username.
