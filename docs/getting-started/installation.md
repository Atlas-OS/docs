# :material-package-down: Installing AtlasOS

!!! danger "Read before continuing"

    AtlasOS complies with the Windows EULA and does not modify Windows activation. Installing Atlas will not activate Windows.
    
    We recommended looking at our page on [who Atlas is for](../faq-and-troubleshooting/who-is-atlas-for.md) before installing.

## :material-clipboard-list-outline: Prerequisites

- Meeting the system requirements for [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-11-specifications#table1) or [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-specifications#primaryR2)
    - We strongly recommend choosing Windows 11 if you meet the official requirements
- 64-bit CPU ([you can check what you have](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-windows-operating-system-am-i-running-628bec99-476a-2c13-5296-9dd081cdd808))
    - If you have an ARM-based CPU, you can only use Atlas with Windows 11
- Knowledge of general Windows troubleshooting and usage

## :material-disc: Download an ISO

Before installing Atlas, you need to reinstall Windows. To fully reinstall Windows, you need to download your desired Windows version's ISO file, which will be used later in the guide.

<span class="noJs">The buttons below download an ISO directly from Microsoft's servers. It gets the latest version of your desired Windows version for [Intel and AMD CPUs](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/132836-check-what-processor-cpu-windows-pc.html#option1).</span> ARM ISOs have to be [built manually](https://uupdump.net/fetchupd.php?arch=arm64&ring=retail&build=22631.1).

## :material-ethernet: Network Drivers

By default, Windows may not have your computer's network drivers, meaning your computer would be left without a network connection.

For this reason, we **strongly** recommend that you either:

- Download your network drivers beforehand and store them on external storage
- Have the ability to download and transfer network drivers from another device later

You can find your network driver online by searching for your device/motherboard's official support page or your network device's name in [Device Manager](../assets/images/device-manager-nic.webp) instead. If multiple of the latest network drivers are available on your device, download all of them.

## :material-microsoft-windows: Reinstalling Windows

???+ info "USB Installation (optional)"

    The method listed here **does not** require a USB stick. Using a USB stick or not will practically have the same result.
    <h2>Using the Media Creation Tool</h4>
    
    1. [Follow the guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/reinstall-windows-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7#bkmk_clean_install_of_windows_10_using_installation_media){:target="_blank"}
    2. Disconnect any cables providing your computer internet, such as an ethernet cable
        - Do not reconnect to the internet until instructed to
    3. Install Windows using your USB stick
    4. Skip to [**Initial Setup (OOBE)**](#initial-setup-oobe)
    
    <h2>Using Ventoy</h4>
    
    !!! trick "You can store files other than ISOs on the Ventoy USB stick. It won't break anything."

    1. Disable Secure Boot in your BIOS
    2. Download the latest Windows release of Ventoy from [here](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/){:target="_blank"} and extract it wherever you feel comfortable
    3. From the extracted folder run `Ventoy2Disk.exe`
    4. In the opened window select your USB stick and press "Install"
    5. Drag (copy) the downloaded ISO file into the bigger partition of the USB stick
    
    6. Disconnect any cables providing your computer internet, such as an ethernet cable
        - Do not reconnect to the internet until instructed to
    7. Boot from the USB stick (you may want to refer to [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/reinstall-windows-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7#ID0EDBBBBBBBDBD){:target="_blank"})
    8. You will be shown a menu with each ISO file where you need to pick the right one using ++enter++
    9. Choose "Boot in normal mode" using the same key
    10. Skip to [**Initial Setup (OOBE)**](#initial-setup-oobe). **You won't need to type in `oobe\bypassnro` with Ventoy**.


Your current Windows installation should be moved to a `Windows.old` folder after reinstalling. You can delete this after reinstalling Windows, which will be covered later. However, you should still externally backup files before proceeding.

1. Disconnect any cables providing internet to your computer, such as an ethernet cable. Do not reconnect it until instructed to do so

1. Right-click the previously downloaded ISO file and select **Open With** -> **File Explorer** to mount it

1. Open **This PC**, and note down the mounted ISO's drive letter (e.g. `H:`) for the next step. The drive should look similar to ![Windows Setup icon](../assets/images/win-setup.webp){ .twemoji } **CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-GB_DV9**

1. Press ++win+r++ to open the Run dialog

1. Type in your noted-down drive letter, including the colon, and then **without a space**, type `\sources\setup.exe` after it. [**Example:** `H:\sources\setup.exe`](../assets/images/win-setup-run-dialog.webp)

1. Press ++enter++ on the Run dialog, and accept the User Account Control prompt
    - The message ["Make sure BitLocker Drive Encryption is suspended"](../assets/images/bitlocker-error-setup.jpg) could appear from the Windows Setup when you press ++enter++. Refer to our [BitLocker decrypting instructions](../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/decryptying-using-bitlocker.md) to resolve this, and then attempt this again


1. Select **No thanks** when prompted for updates and uncheck the box for **I want to help make the Windows installation better**

1. Click **I don't have a product key**, as Windows will activate automatically later, presuming that Windows is legitimately activated beforehand

1. Choose your edition of Windows. We strongly recommend and officially support Windows Pro, with **Windows Home not being officially supported.** See our page on [Windows Editions](../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/windows-editions.md) for more information

1. Accept the license agreement and click **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)**

1. Select your Windows drive, click next, click **OK** to the warning about `Windows.old`, and let the installation finish

## :material-screwdriver: Driver Updates

Drivers are essential software components that enable the OS to communicate with hardware devices. While Windows comes with basic drivers pre-installed, some devices, such as Bluetooth devices, printers, or speakers, likely require additional drivers to function correctly.
On Atlas, there are two options for driver installation:

| :material-update: Installation & Updates from Windows Update | :material-download: Manual Installation & Updates |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| :material-check-all: Easiest if you don't know how to get drivers | :material-check-all: Potentially less system resource usage |
| :material-check: Best compatibility, especially with OEM apps | :material-check-all: Less potential bloat/annoyances |
| :material-check-all: Latest security & feature updates automatically | :material-check: Full control over your driver versions |
| :material-check: Almost never having to manually get drivers | :material-alert-circle-outline: You will likely need to get drivers for new devices |

**Choose the option you wish to install with and follow the instructions.**

If you don't know, choose 'Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update.'

=== "Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update"
    1. Connect your device to the internet

    1. Move on to the next section

=== "Manual Driver Installation"
    Don't connect to the internet yet, follow these steps:

    1. Open **Settings** -> **Windows Update**

    1. Temporarily **Pause Updates** for at least 1 week

    1. Connect your device to the internet
    
    1. Move on to the next section

## :material-wrench-cog-outline: Installing AtlasOS

??? danger "AME Wizard suddenly closing or being deleted?"
    Add AME Wizard as an exclusion or disable **Real-time protection** in the Windows Security settings. This is usually necessary when a new version of AME Wizard is released, which has not been used much yet.

    To read more about this, view our [**AME Wizard Deleted**](../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/ame-wizard-deleted.md) page.

!!! warning "Remote Desktop"
    You can't use Remote Desktop to install Atlas due to a bug in AME Wizard v0.7.4, the latest version as of writing this.
    This issue will be fixed in the next AME Wizard release.
    This also includes Hyper-V with its Enhanced Session Mode, which needs to be disabled for a successful installation.
    
    You can use Remote Desktop after installing Atlas.

1. Open Microsoft Edge, search [`atlasos.net`](https://atlasos.net), then download the **Atlas Playbook** and **AME Wizard**

1. Extract both downloads to your desktop

1. If you have chosen [**Manual Driver Installation**](#driver-updates), run `Disable Drivers Installation in Windows Update.reg` from the extracted Atlas Playbook download and restart

1. Open **Settings** and update Windows, including optional updates, until no more updates are available. If paused, un-pause Windows Updates to follow this step
    - If there's an error updating on Windows 10, see our page on [:material-update: Windows Update Errors](../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/windows-update-errors.md#windows-10-error-0x80070643) for a fix, retry updating, and continue with the rest of the installation guide

1. Open the **Microsoft Store** and update all apps that have pending updates

1. Restart after all updates are complete. After restarting, check again for updates repeatedly until there are no more updates that pop up

1. Open `AME Wizard Beta.exe` from the AME Wizard folder
    1. If there is a warning from SmartScreen that AME Wizard is an [unrecognized application](../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/ame-wizard-deleted.md#why-is-it-being-falsely-flagged), bypass this warning by clicking **More info** and **Run anyway**
    1. Click on **Updates** at the top and make sure AME Wizard is up to date

1. Drag `Atlas Playbook.apbx` from the Atlas Playbook folder into AME Wizard

1. Follow the on-screen instructions from AME Wizard to successfully install AtlasOS

### :material-microsoft-windows-classic: Your old Windows installation

If you reinstalled Windows using the method in the documentation, your previous Windows installation should be in `Windows.old`. When you're sure that you've retrieved any valuable data from it, follow these steps:

1. Open **Windows Settings** -> **System** -> **Storage**
1. Click **Temporary files**, and wait for it to scan your files
1. Select **Previous version of Windows**, and then click **Remove files**

## :material-package-variant-closed-plus: Getting your drivers

You're almost finished with setting up Atlas. Before you start setting up software, follow the option you chose earlier to get your drivers:

- **Manual Driver Installation:** If this is you, we recommend seeing [our post-installation driver guide](post-installation/drivers/getting-started.md) to help set up the needed drivers.

- **Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update:** If this is you, get drivers by manually checking for Windows Updates. To get them automatically, enable [automatic Windows Updates](../getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/general-configuration.md#automatic-updates).

## :material-flag-checkered: All done!

If you need any help, you can find links below to a large community of individuals who are dedicated to helping others, as well as a few other areas of the documentation.
