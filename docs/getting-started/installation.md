# :material-package-down: Installing AtlasOS

This guide will walk you through fully reinstalling Windows, installing Atlas on top of it, and completing other necessary steps. A full Windows reinstall is needed to ensure stability during the initial installation of Atlas.

Before continuing, we recommend reviewing our page to see [who Atlas is for](../install-faq/who-is-atlas-for.md).

## **0.** :material-clipboard-list-outline: Prerequisites

- Meeting the system requirements for [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-11-specifications#table1) or [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications#primaryR2)
    - We don't recommend bypassing Windows 11's requirements due to potential problems with updates and game anti-cheats
- 64-bit CPU ([you can check what you have](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-windows-operating-system-am-i-running-628bec99-476a-2c13-5296-9dd081cdd808))
    - If you have an ARM-based CPU, you can only use Atlas with Windows 11
- Knowledge of general Windows troubleshooting and usage

<!-- --8<-- [start:iso] -->
## **1.** :material-disc: Download an ISO
<!-- --8<-- [end:iso] -->

Before installing Atlas, you need to reinstall Windows. <!-- --8<-- [start:iso1] -->
To fully reinstall Windows, you need to download your desired Windows version's ISO file, which will be used later in the guide.

<span class="noJs">The buttons below download an ISO directly from Microsoft's servers. It gets the latest version of your desired Windows version for [Intel and AMD CPUs](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/132836-check-what-processor-cpu-windows-pc.html#option1).</span> ARM ISOs have to be [built manually](https://uupdump.net/fetchupd.php?arch=arm64&ring=retail&build=22631.1).

<noscript>
<b>The documentation's Windows ISO downloader doesn't show for you due to the documentation being loaded without JavaScript.</b>
See the alternatives below.
</noscript>

!!! question "Which version should I choose?"
    If you meet the official requirements, we **strongly** recommend choosing Windows 11. If not, use Windows 10.

## **2.** :material-ethernet: Network Drivers

By default, Windows may not have your computer's network drivers, meaning after reinstalling, your computer could have no internet connection.

For this reason, we **strongly** recommend that you do one of the following:

- Download your network drivers beforehand and store them on external storage
- Have the ability to download and transfer network drivers from another device later

!!! question "Where do I get my network drivers?"
    You can find your computer's network drivers online by searching for your device or motherboard's official support page. If you can't find it, try searching online for your network device's name in [Device Manager](../assets/images/device-manager-nic.webp) instead. If multiple of the latest network drivers are available, download them all.
<!-- --8<-- [end:drivers] -->

<!-- --8<-- [start:reinstalling] -->
## **3.** :material-microsoft-windows: Reinstalling Windows

Before continuing, we **strongly** recommend you back up any valuable data to an external drive or [a cloud service](https://mega.io/).

=== ":material-microsoft: No USB Drive (recommended)"

    <!-- --8<-- [start:windowsOldNotice] -->
    **Presuming you have enough free storage**, after finishing the Windows reinstall, `Windows.old` will be at the start of your Windows drive, containing your old data. You can delete this folder afterward, which this guide [covers later](#your-old-windows-installation).
    <!-- --8<-- [end:windowsOldNotice] -->

    This method only works if you're already on Windows.

    1. Disconnect any cables providing internet to your computer, such as an ethernet cable. Do not reconnect any until instructed to do so

    1. Right-click the previously downloaded ISO file and select **Open With** -> **File Explorer**

    1. Open **This PC** in File Explorer, and remember the ISO's drive letter (e.g. `H`) for the next step. The drive should look similar to ![Windows Setup icon](../assets/images/win-setup.webp){ .twemoji } **CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-GB_DV9**

    1. Press ++win+r++ to open the Run dialog

    1. Inside the Run dialog, type in the previously remembered drive letter, and then **without a space**, type `:\sources\setup.exe` after it. [**Example:** `H:\sources\setup.exe`](../assets/images/win-setup-run-dialog.webp)

    1. Press ++enter++ on the Run dialog, and accept the User Account Control prompt
        - The message ["Make sure BitLocker Drive Encryption is suspended"](../assets/images/bitlocker-error-setup.jpg) could appear from the Windows Setup when you press ++enter++. Refer to our [BitLocker decrypting instructions](../install-faq/decrypting-using-bitlocker.md) to resolve this, and then attempt this step again

    1. Select **No thanks** when prompted for updates, then uncheck the box for **I want to help make the Windows installation better**

    1. If prompted, click **I don't have a product key**, as Windows should auto-activate later
        - If Windows doesn't auto-activate, you can enter a key later within Windows

    1. Choose your edition of Windows
    <!-- --8<-- [end:reinstalling] -->
    <!-- --8<-- [start:atlasEditions] -->
        - [Windows Pro](../install-faq/windows-version-support.md) is recommended. [Windows Home is not officially supported](../install-faq/windows-home.md)
        - If the Windows Setup did not give a choice of edition and it installs Windows Home anyway, you can always change Windows edition later by changing your Windows product key once Windows has finished reinstalling, without having to reinstall Atlas
    <!-- --8<-- [end:atlasEditions] -->
    <!-- --8<-- [start:reinstalling1] -->

    1. Accept the license agreement and click **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)**

    1. Select your Windows drive, click **Next**, click **OK** to the warning about `Windows.old`, and let the installation finish

=== ":material-usb-flash-drive: USB Drive"

    This method works on Linux and Windows.

    1. Download the latest release of [Ventoy :material-download:](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/) and extract it wherever you feel comfortable.        
        - Linux users can get it using a package manager

    1. Inside the Ventoy folder, run **Ventoy2Disk**

    1. In the opened window, select your USB drive and click **Install**
        - This will destroy all data on the USB drive!

    1. Copy your downloaded ISO file into the USB drive (labeled Ventoy)

    1. Disconnect any cables providing your computer internet, such as an ethernet cable
        - Do not reconnect to the internet until instructed to

    1. Using the BIOS menu, boot from the USB drive

            5\. Choose `ENROLL_THIS_KEY_IN_MOKMANAGER.cer`

            6\. Choose **Continue**, then **Yes**, and finally **Reboot**
            
            7\. Boot from the USB again, as the issue should be resolved

            ------

            If it is still not working, try 'Hash Enrollment,' as detailed in [Ventoy's guide](https://ventoy.net/doc_secure.html).

## **4.** :material-screwdriver: Driver Updates

Drivers are essential software components that enable the OS to communicate with hardware devices. While Windows has fundamental drivers, some devices may need external drivers to function correctly.
On Atlas, there are two options for external drivers:

| :material-update: Installation & Updates from Windows Update | :material-download: Manual Installation & Updates |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| :material-check-all: Easiest if you don't know how to get drivers | :material-check-all: Potentially less system resource usage |
| :material-check: Best compatibility, especially with OEM apps | :material-check-all: Less potentially unwanted applications |
| :material-check-all: Latest security & feature updates automatically | :material-check: Full control over your driver versions |
| :material-check: Almost never having to manually get drivers | :material-alert-circle-outline: You will likely need to get drivers for new devices |

**Choose the option you wish to install with and follow the instructions.**

If you don't know, choose 'Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update.'

=== "Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update"
    1. Connect your device to the internet

    1. Move on to the next section

=== "Manual Driver Installation"
    Don't connect to the internet yet, follow these steps:

    1. Open **Settings** -> **Windows Update**

    1. Temporarily **Pause Updates** for at least one week

    1. Connect your device to the internet
    
    1. Move on to the next section

## **5.** :material-wrench-cog-outline: Installing AtlasOS

??? danger "AME Wizard suddenly closing or being deleted?"
    Especially when a new version of AME Wizard is released, you might need to add AME Wizard as an exclusion or turn off **Real-time protection** in Windows Security. 

    To read more about this, view our [**AME Wizard Deleted**](../install-faq/ame-wizard-errors/ame-wizard-deleted.md) page.

1. Open Microsoft Edge, search [`atlasos.net`](https://atlasos.net), then download the **Atlas Playbook** and **AME Wizard**

1. Extract both downloads to your desktop

1. If you have chosen [**Manual Driver Installation**](#driver-updates), run `Disable Drivers Installation in Windows Update.reg` from the extracted Atlas Playbook download and restart

1. Open **Settings** and update Windows, including optional updates, until no more updates are available. If paused, click **Resume Updates** to follow this step
    - If there's an error updating on Windows 10, see our page on [:material-update: Windows Update Errors](../general-faq/windows-update-errors.md#windows-10-error-0x80070643) for a fix, retry updating, and continue with the rest of the installation guide

1. Open the **Microsoft Store** and update all apps
    - There might be a prompt to update the Microsoft Store first

1. Restart after all updates are complete. After restarting, check again for updates repeatedly until there are no more available updates

1. Open `AME Wizard Beta.exe` from the AME Wizard folder
    1. If there is a warning from SmartScreen that AME Wizard is an [unrecognized application](../install-faq/ame-wizard-errors/ame-wizard-deleted.md#why-is-it-being-falsely-flagged), bypass this warning by clicking **More info** and **Run anyway**
    1. Click on **Updates** at the top and make sure AME Wizard is up to date

1. Drag `Atlas Playbook.apbx` from the Atlas Playbook folder into AME Wizard
