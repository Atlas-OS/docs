## :material-package-variant-closed-plus: **3.1** Getting your drivers

You've almost finished setting up Atlas!

- **Manual Driver Installation:** If you previously chose this, we recommend seeing [our post-installation driver guide](post-installation/drivers/getting-started.md) to help set up the needed drivers.

- **Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update:** If you previously chose this, get drivers by manually checking for Windows Updates. To get them automatically, enable [automatic Windows Updates](../getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/general-configuration.md#automatic-updates).

## :material-flag-checkered: All done!

If you need any help, you can find links below to a large community of individuals who are dedicated to helping others, as well as a few other areas of the documentation.

We hope you enjoy using AtlasOS! :smile:
