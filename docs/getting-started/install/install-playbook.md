## :material-disc: **1.** Download an ISO
<!-- --8<-- [end:iso] -->

Before installing Atlas, you need a clean ISO to fully reinstall Windows.

<!-- --8<-- [start:iso1] -->
Choose your desired Windows version's ISO file, which will be used later in the guide.

<span class="noJs">The buttons below download an ISO directly from Microsoft's servers. It gets the latest version of your desired Windows version for [Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/132836-check-what-processor-cpu-windows-pc.html#option1).</span>

<noscript>
<b>The documentation's Windows ISO downloader doesn't show for you due to the documentation being loaded without JavaScript.</b>
See the alternatives below.
</noscript>

!!! question "Which version should I choose?"
    If you are using a **Intel or AMD CPU** with the `x86_64` archetecture, Download the x86_64 version.

    If you are using a **Snapdragon SoC** with the `ARM64` archetecture, Download the ARM64 version.

??? grey-tip "Alternatives"

    !!! tip 
        Even though the downloader in our docs uses official Microsoft servers, you can still download the ISO directly from their website.
        
    <div id="official-microsoft-sources"></div>
    === "Official Microsoft Sources"

        ### [Windows 11 :material-download:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)

        - Click the link above and find "Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices"
        - Click on the"Select Download" dropdown, choose **Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO)**, and click **Confirm.**
        - Select your desired language and press confirm.
        - Click **64-bit Download** to begin your download.

## :material-ethernet: **2.** Network Drivers

By default, Windows may not have your computer's network drivers, meaning after reinstalling, your computer could have no internet connection.

For this reason, we **strongly** recommend that you do one of the following:

- Download your network drivers beforehand and store them on external storage
- Have the ability to download and transfer network drivers from another device later

!!! question "Where do I get my network drivers?"
    !!! info inline ""
        ![](/assets/images/device-manager-nic.webp)

    You can find your computer's network drivers online by searching for your device or motherboard's official support page. 

    If you can't find it, try searching online for your network device's name in Device Manager instead. 
    
    If multiple of the latest network drivers are available, download them all.
    

    
<!-- --8<-- [end:drivers] -->


## :material-microsoft-windows: **3.** Reinstalling Windows

Before continuing, we **strongly** recommend you back up any valuable data to an external drive or [a cloud service](before-continuing.md).

=== ":material-microsoft: No USB Drive (recommended)"

    <!-- --8<-- [start:windowsOldNotice] -->
    **Only if you have enough free storage**, after finishing the Windows reinstall, `Windows.old` will be at the start of your Windows drive, containing your old data. You can retrieve data from the folder and delete it afterward, which this guide [covers later](#your-old-windows-installation).
    <!-- --8<-- [end:windowsOldNotice] -->

    This method only works if you're already on Windows.

    1. Disconnect any cables providing internet to your computer, such as an ethernet cable. Do not reconnect any until instructed to do so

    1. Right-click the previously downloaded ISO file and select **Open With** -> **File Explorer**

    1. Open **This PC** in File Explorer, and remember the ISO's drive letter (e.g. `H`) for the next step. The drive should look similar to ![Windows Setup icon](/assets/images/win-setup.webp){ .twemoji } **CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-GB_DV9**

    1. Press ++win+r++ to open the Run dialog

    1. Inside the Run dialog, type in the previously remembered drive letter, and then **without a space**, type `:\sources\setup.exe` after it. [**Example:** `H:\sources\setup.exe`](/assets/images/win-setup-run-dialog.webp)

    1. Press ++enter++ on the Run dialog, and accept the User Account Control prompt
    - The message ["Make sure BitLocker Drive Encryption is suspended"](/assets/images/bitlocker-error-setup.jpg) could appear from the Windows Setup when you press ++enter++. Refer to our [BitLocker decrypting instructions](../../faq/install.md) to resolve this, then retry from step 5 onwards

    1. Select **No thanks** when prompted for updates, then uncheck the box for **I want to help make the Windows installation better**

    1. If prompted, click **I don't have a product key**, as Windows should auto-activate later
        - If Windows doesn't auto-activate, you can enter a key later within Windows

    1. Choose your edition of Windows.
    <!-- --8<-- [end:reinstalling] -->
    <!-- --8<-- [start:atlasEditions] -->

    !!! note "Supported Editions"

        - Windows Pro
        - Windows Pro for Workstation
        - Windows Enterprise (Excluding LTSC, IoT LTSC)

        **Windows Home is not Supported.** If the Windows Setup did not give a choice of edition and it installs Windows Home anyway, you can always change Windows edition later by changing your Windows product key once Windows has finished reinstalling, without having to reinstall anything.
    <!-- --8<-- [end:atlasEditions] -->

    !!! note "Windows 11 Requirement Error?"
        If installing Windows 11 and you encounter an error stating your PC doesn't meet the requirements, you might need to enable TPM 2.0 in your BIOS/UEFI. See our guide: [:link: Enabling TPM 2.0](../../faq/general.md)

    <!-- --8<-- [start:reinstalling1] -->

    1. Accept the license agreement and click **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)**

    1. Select your Windows drive, click **Next**, click **OK** to the warning about `Windows.old`, and let the installation finish

=== ":material-usb-flash-drive: USB Drive"

    This method works on Linux and Windows.

    1. Download the latest release of [Ventoy :material-download:](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/) and extract it wherever you feel comfortable.        
        - Linux users can get it using a package manager

    1. Inside the Ventoy folder, run **Ventoy2Disk**

    1. In the opened window, select your USB drive and click **Install**
        - This will destroy all data on the USB drive!

    1. Copy your downloaded ISO file into the USB drive (labeled Ventoy)

    1. Disconnect any cables providing your computer internet, such as an ethernet cable
        - Do not reconnect to the internet until instructed to

    1. Restart your computer, boot into your BIOS' boot menu, then select the USB drive

            5\. Choose `ENROLL_THIS_KEY_IN_MOKMANAGER.cer`

            6\. Choose **Continue**, then **Yes**, and finally **Reboot**
            
            7\. Boot from the USB again, as the issue should be resolved

            ------

            If it is still not working, try 'Hash Enrollment,' as detailed in [Ventoy's guide](https://ventoy.net/doc_secure.html).

    1. Once booted into the Ventoy menu, select the Windows ISO using the arrow keys, press ++enter++, click **Boot in normal mode**, and press ++enter++ again

## :material-screwdriver: **5.** Driver Updates

Drivers are essential software components that enable the OS to communicate with hardware devices. While Windows has fundamental drivers, some devices need external drivers to function correctly.
On Atlas, there are two options for external drivers:

| :material-update: Installation & Updates from Windows Update | :material-download: Manual Installation & Updates |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| :material-check-all: Easiest if you don't know how to get drivers | :material-check-all: Potentially less system resource usage |
| :material-check: Best compatibility, especially with OEM apps | :material-check-all: Less potentially unwanted applications |
| :material-check-all: Latest security & feature updates automatically | :material-check: Full control over your driver versions |
| :material-check: Almost never having to manually get drivers | :material-alert-circle-outline: You will likely need to get drivers for new devices |

**Choose the option you wish to install with and follow the instructions.**

If you don't know, choose 'Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update.'

=== "Driver Installation & Updates from Windows Update"
    1. Connect your device to the internet

    1. Move on to the next section

=== "Manual Driver Installation"
    Don't connect to the internet yet, follow these steps:

    1. Open **Settings** -> **Windows Update**

    1. Temporarily **Pause Updates** for at least one week

    1. Connect your device to the internet
