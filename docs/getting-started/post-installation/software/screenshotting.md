# :material-camera: Screenshotting

In Windows, the Snipping Tool is not included in Atlas by default. It can be reinstalled from the Microsoft Store. However, we've kept the shortcut for quickly taking screenshots: ++win+shift+s++.

If you're looking for something more advanced, we recommend the following options.

## ShareX

ShareX is an advanced tool for capturing screenshots that not only allows you to take screenshots of your screen but also provides advanced options to edit and enhance the captured images. With a wide range of features, ShareX stands out as the best option for capturing and editing screenshots, making it the ideal choice for most users.

`winget install -e --id ShareX.ShareX`
