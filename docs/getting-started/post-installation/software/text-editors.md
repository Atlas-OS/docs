# :material-text: Text editors and IDEs

Text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are powerful tools for programming and writing code. However, we suggest using a word processor for writing documents. There are numerous options for text editors and IDEs, and we have compiled a list of some of them in our software installation script.

By default we have Notepad installed. If you're looking to spice it up, check some of the options below.

## Notepad++

Notepad++ is a text editor that is more advanced than Notepad. It allows you to easily write code or documents. Notepad++ is highly customizable, making it a versatile tool for power users.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, also known as VSCode, is a rich text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). While it can be useful for writing both code and text, you may want to use Notepad++ for text editing.
