# :material-text: Text editors and IDEs

Text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are robust programming and code tools. However, we suggest using a word processor to write documents, like [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/). There are numerous options for text editors and IDEs, and we have compiled a list of some of them in our software installation script.

By default, Windows has Notepad installed. If you want something more advanced, check some of the options below.

## Notepad++

Notepad++ is a more advanced text editor than Notepad. It allows you to write code or edit any other text files, with syntax highlighting and more. Notepad++ is highly customizable, making it a versatile tool for power users.

`winget install -e --id Notepad++.Notepad++`

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, or VSCode, is a feature-rich text editor at an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) level. It supports plugins and many programming languages and has an intuitive user interface.

`winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`
