# :simple-vlcmediaplayer: Media Player

## VLC Media Player

VLC is one of the most well-known media players because it is simple and works well. It has all the codecs you'll need installed and ready for playback.

`winget install -e --id VideoLAN.VLC`

## mpv

For media enthusiasts, mpv is an excellent minimal player that supports almost all codecs. Advanced features include scripting and customization options.

### mpv.net

For a more accessible experience, we suggest using mpv.net, a fork of mpv with a more user-friendly graphical interface. It is available on the Microsoft Store for convenient access.

`winget install -e --id mpv.net`

## Windows Media Player

Microsoft has recently given a fresh update to Windows Media Player, which is now available by default on the latest versions of Windows. The updated version comes with a modern and user-friendly interface.

However, unlike mpv or VLC Media Player, it does not support all codecs. You may need to install codec expansion packs to view specific media files in Windows Media Player.
