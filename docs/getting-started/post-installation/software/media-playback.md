We keep Windows Media Player Legacy by default, if you're looking for something else we'll cover more options in this guide.

## VLC Media Player

One of the most known media players, because it does it well. It has all codecs you'll need installed and ready for playback.

`winget install -e --id VideoLAN.VLC`

[Download VLC Media Player](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=XPDM1ZW6815MQM)

## MPV

MPV is primarily meant to be used through the command line. However, we recommend using a fork of MPV that comes with a more user-friendly graphical interface and is available on the Microsoft Store for easier access. MPV supports a wide variety of video outputs and offers many features that are highly valued by video enthusiasts.

## Windows Media Player

Windows Media Player is a built-in feature of Windows operating system, but it is not included in Atlas by default. It is a useful tool for playing videos and music, and it offers more advanced features than the Film & TV app. However, it does not include all codecs like MPV or VLC Media Player by default. To use Windows Media Player, you may need to install a codec expansion pack.

## Film & TV

Windows has a built-in video app called Film & TV. However, it is not included by default in Atlas. This app is useful for playing videos and provides more advanced features than Windows Media Player. It is important to note that Film & TV does not include all codecs like MPV or VLC Media Player by default and may require users to purchase additional codecs.
