# :material-wrench-cog-outline: What about other drivers?

When it comes to other drivers, which include Bluetooth, scanners, and printer drivers we recommend to **download directly from the OEM of the device**, and then using SDIO as a backup option if you have issues.

By this, we mean searching the **device model** or **motherboard manufacturer** as they have the drivers listed and work more efficiently than SDIO generic drivers.

Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO) scans your device for connected and wireless devices that don't have drivers. It's not recommended to select drivers where you don't have issues.

## :material-screwdriver: Snappy Driver Installer Origin

Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO) can help you find drivers that are compatible with your hardware. SDIO scans your system for missing or outdated drivers and installs the most up-to-date ones for you. It's highly discouraged to install all driver's SDIO lists. You should only make changes, update or install drivers if you have issues specifically with devices.

1. Visit [their website](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin) and download the installer under the "Download Application" section.
2. Extract the .zip file and open the ``x64`` file. Follow the steps in the wizard.
    * The x64 build is the only one that works with Atlas.
    * When prompted, select "Download indexes only". Otherwise, you'll download useless drivers.
3. Wait for SDIO to download the indexes.
4. Select drivers to install and press "Install" on the left.
