# :custom-intel: Installing Intel graphics drivers

We recommend installing your Intel graphics drivers from one of the following:

1. The [official Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005629/graphics/processor-graphics.html)

1. Your device/motherboard support or driver page
    - **Recommended search query:** `manufacturer` + `model` + driver
    - **Example:** MSI B450-A PRO driver.
