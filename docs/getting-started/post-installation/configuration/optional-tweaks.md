# Optional Tweaks

These are some cool tweaks that you can turn on. For example, you could change the old alt-tab to the new one or bring back the old one. You can pick and use any of the options.

All of the configuration files listed here are located in the `3. Configuration/4. Optional Tweaks` folder. In the Atlas folder which is on the Desktop. If you deleted the folder, you can find it in `C:/Users/default/Desktop/` or download it via our [GitHub](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/main/src/Executables/Atlas).

## :material-swap-horizontal-circle-outline: Alt-Tab

The Alt-Tab folder lets you choose whether to use the new Alt-Tab menu or the old one. The new one is used in Windows 10, and the old one is used in Windows 7.

AtlasOS comes with the Legacy Alt-Tab, but you can run the ``Modern Alt-Tab.reg`` file to get the modern one.

## :material-chip: CPU Idle in context menu

By running the ``Add Idle toggle in context menu.reg``, you can toggle idle on and off from the context menu.

This is another folder that lets you change how your default file explorer works. Here, we'll talk about each option.

By running the ``Network Pane.reg`` file, you can enable or disable the network pane.

## :material-menu: Send To Context Menu

With the ``Debloat Send To Context Menu.cmd`` file, you can reduce the items in the "Send to context" menu.
