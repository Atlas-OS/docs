# :material-rocket-launch: Upgrading AtlasOS

> **TLDR:** If you're already running AtlasOS **v0.4.x or later**, you can upgrade straight to a newer version (for example v0.5.x) with AME Wizard. Clean installs are not required, but are still recommended.  

## Requirements

* Your PC must currently have **AtlasOS 0.4.x or newer** installed.  
  Users on **0.3.x** need to perform a fresh install instead.
* The latest **AME Wizard** executable.  
* The **new Atlas Playbook** (`.apbx`) you want to upgrade to (e.g. `Atlas Playbook 0.5.x`).

If you've met all of the requirements above, click below to proceed to the next step.
