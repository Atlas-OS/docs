# Getting Started

We have made sure to make installing Atlas easy. The installation process only takes a few minutes longer, than when you normally install Windows. Now, let us start setting up Atlas.

You can find the installation guide [here](installation/)

!!! warning "Atlas is not pre-activated"
    Atlas is **not** a pre-activated version of Windows. If you want to run Atlas legally, you need to have your own Windows license. Before you buy a Windows (Pro OR Home) license, make sure that the seller is trusted and that the key is legitimate, no matter where you buy it.

!!! question "Do you provide an ISO?"
    No, Atlas has stopped providing ISOs to download to prevent breaking Microsoft ToS. This also allows people to update Windows before they install Atlas to get the most recent version of Windows.

!!! question "Need help?"
    If you face any trouble while installing, you can ask for help on our [forums](https://forum.atlasos.net/), or our [Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/atlas-795710270000332800). We have a big community of people who care and want to help.
