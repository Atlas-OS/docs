# :material-emoticon-cry: Reverting Atlas

As Atlas disables the 'Reset this PC' feature due to its unreliability and not being a true reinstall of Windows, some users get confused about how to uninstall Atlas.

This page details how to reinstall from Atlas to vanilla Windows.

## :material-handshake: Before uninstalling

If you're experiencing issues, ensure you're on the [latest version of Atlas](installation.md), and then consider getting help from the following:

- :material-file-search: The documentation you're on currently
- <a style="cursor: pointer" onclick="const button=document.querySelector('#kapa-widget-container > button'); if (button) button.click();">
    <p>:material-robot: 'Ask AI' in the corner of this page</p>
  </a>
- [:simple-discord: Our Discord server](https://discord.atlasos.net)
- [:material-forum: The Atlas forums](https://forum.atlasos.net)

### If you're still having problems...

We're constantly improving Atlas, so although you're uninstalling now, we hope to see your problem solved in the future.

Please consider reporting your problem on the [Atlas GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues) so we can fix it.
Alternatively, give feedback in our forums or Discord, as mentioned earlier.
