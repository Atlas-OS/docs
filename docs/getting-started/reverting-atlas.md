# :material-emoticon-cry: Reverting Atlas

As Atlas disables the 'Reset this PC' feature due to its unreliability and not being a true reinstall of Windows, some users get confused about how to get back to stock Windows.

This page details how to reinstall from Atlas to stock Windows fully, which uninstalls Atlas.

## :material-handshake: Before uninstalling

If you're experiencing issues, ensure you're on the [latest version of Atlas](installation.md), and then consider getting help from the following:

- :material-file-search: The documentation you're on currently
- <a onclick="clickKapaAi();" href="javascript:void(0)">
    :material-robot: 'Ask AI' in the corner of this page
  </a>
- [:simple-discord: Our Discord server](https://discord.atlasos.net)
- [:material-github: Atlas' GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/discussions)

### If you're still having problems...

We're constantly improving Atlas, so although you're uninstalling now, we hope to see your problem solved in the future.

Please consider reporting your problem on the [Atlas GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues) so we can fix it.
