# :material-microsoft-windows-classic: How do I fix AME Wizard saying that this Windows build is not supported?

**You have likely not followed the installation documentation to reinstall Windows.**

Atlas requires you to follow the installation documentation to reinstall the latest version of Windows. We advise against using the **Reset this PC** feature within Windows, as this is not considered a full Windows reinstall, and would likely not solve this issue.

[Installing AtlasOS -->](../../getting-started/installation.md)
