# :material-cog: Components and features removed or disabled from Atlas

Atlas turns off many unnecessary Windows components and features for optimal performance, usability, and privacy; for some features or components, enabling them again requires manual tweaking. We have compiled a list of most of Atlas's changes on this page.

To see the exact changes made, refer to the [Atlas source code](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas).

## :material-delete: What's permanently deleted?

These components require a Windows reinstall to get back.

- [Smart App Control](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/what-is-smart-app-control-285ea03d-fa88-4d56-882e-6698afdb7003)
    - Once it's disabled in Windows, you can't reinstall it
    - Disabled as it sends lots of data to Microsoft
    - Requires optional diagnostic data in Windows
    - Causes unusable slowdowns if Defender is disabled

## :material-cog-pause: What's disabled?

These components require manual tweaking to re-enable and are not tested.

- Telemetry
    - Atlas has the option to toggle telemetry components for troubleshooting
    - The underlying policies turning off various telemetry have no options in the Atlas folder. This includes Windows Error Reporting, CEIP, and more
- Various syncing using a Microsoft account
- General advertisements and Windows tips
- Uncommonly used context menus
- Activity history
