# :material-list-status: Which Windows versions does Atlas support?

**Atlas supports the latest stable Windows 10 and 11 versions in the same download. However, [Windows Home editions aren't supported.](windows-home.md)**

---

Atlas only supports the latest, [non-beta/non-Insider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Insider) versions of Windows 10 and 11. Insider isn't supported for stability and privacy, as it usually has bugs we can't account for, and it requires sending extra diagnostic data to Microsoft.

We *strongly recommend* following our [installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md) for installing a supported version, as the initial Atlas install requires a Windows reinstallation regardless.

## :material-package: Which Windows editions are supported?

We recommend **Windows Pro** or **Windows Enterprise**. [Except for Windows Home](windows-home.md), most other Windows editions are also supported.

The only exclusions to this are:

- Enterprise LTSC editions
    - Atlas already debloats Windows' included apps
- Windows Server
    - Supporting it would require too much extra testing
