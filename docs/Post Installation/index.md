# Post Installation

When you have installed Atlas, you will need to open the Atlas folder on your Desktop and follow through each step 1 by 1 to fully install Atlas, sadly the OS does not work at it's best out of the box. For example you will need to install your drivers on your PC, all this will be explained in the Atlas folder for all users to read.

Once you have completed everything in the Atlas folder, you should have a speedy computer!
