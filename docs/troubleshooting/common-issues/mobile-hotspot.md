To fix this issue, you will need to enable a service. To enable services press ++windows+s++ and type `Services`, it should be the first option. 

From here find the services named `Windows Connect Now - Registrator Config` and `Windows Mobile Hotspot Service` and enable them. You may need to restart for mobile hotspot to start working.
