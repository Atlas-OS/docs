!!! success "Fixed in upcoming release"
	The problematic script here will be removed in v0.3.
	
	It is replaced with [Storage Sense](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/manage-drive-space-with-storage-sense-654f6ada-7bfc-45e5-966b-e24aded96ad5) for an officially supported by Microsoft and lightweight method of automatically cleaning your disk.

If you are experiencing these issues:

- High CPU usage on startup
- Valve anti-cheat (VAC) unable to verify session
- Errors with installers
- Browsers not updating

Then the issue is from a script provided called `Auto-Cleaner.cmd`. Here's how to fix it:

1. Download the fix script [here](https://he3als.xyz/mystuff/scripts/Fix-Auto-Cleaner.bat) and open it
2. Accept the prompt for administrator priviliges if it appears, then press any key to continue
3. Once it completes, restart Windows and it should be fixed
