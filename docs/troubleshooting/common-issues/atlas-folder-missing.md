The Atlas folder is on your desktop by default. If it is not there, you can find the replacement folder in `C:/Users/Default/Desktop`.

If for some reason that folder does not contain the `Atlas` folder, you can get it from our Github repository. Though we do not recommend this method because it means that your Atlas installation may be broken and you may need to reinstall Atlas.

For those who still want to proceed, [here is the download link](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAtlas-OS%2FAtlas%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2FExecutables%2FAtlas) for your convenience.

After it finished downloading, extract the ZIP file by right clicking it, select `7-Zip`, then `Extract to "Atlas.../"`.

You can rename the extracted folder to `Atlas` and store it somewhere safe.
