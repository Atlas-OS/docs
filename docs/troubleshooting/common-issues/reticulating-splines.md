# Reticulating Splines
After running the Playbook with the AME Wizard some people get stuck at the "Recticulating Splines" screen. <br/>
### First possbible fix:
Check if you have **both the AME Wizard and the playbook on your desktop**. If not, please stop the AME Wizard with Task Manager, move both the Wizard and Playbook to your desktop and try again.

### Second possible fix :

1. Open Task Manager.
2. Kill The curl executable,
3. Kill powershell,
4. Kill Windows Command Processor,

The install progress should start again.
