!!! success "Features being added back in v0.3.0"
	In v0.3.0, these features are being added back as optional features:
	
	* Windows Defender
		* Hopefully, Windows Update will be configured to only get security definition updates by default.
		* Windows Defender will slow down performance (especially on older hardware using components like HDDs).
		* Configured with policies by default for the least annoyance.
	* Tools for virus and malware protection (such as SecHealth, HealthCheck, MsMpEng and SmartScreen).
	* Windows Updates
		* It will be configured with policies by default for the least annoyance possible, including manual updates.
		* It is most likely that Windows Updates will revert changes from Atlas, so you might have to re-run the AME Wizard on updates (there might be a tool to check the integrity of the tweaks).
	
	These features will be enabled by default:
	
	* [User Account Control (UAC)](/getting-started/post-installation/configuration/#uac) (already enabled in GitHub Actions builds - [commit](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/commit/2f2f083acd3364c62056ce45a0c2bada9b9399a9))

	See this [tweet](https://twitter.com/AtlasOS/status/1651284816489336832) for more information.
	
	Overall, Atlas will be more transparent from now on, with more clarity and warnings to the user about security.
