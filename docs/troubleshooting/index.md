# Troubleshooting
In this troubleshooting section, you can find common problems and fixes for them. 
These issues and fixes come from the official Atlas Discord server. 

## Password not working
After the second restart when completing the the ame wizzard some people need a password to log into their account. <br />
Try **leaving the password empty or type in "atlas"** to see if that works. <br />
If that doesn't work feel free to make a post in the Atlas forum section on the Atlas Discord server.

## Reticulating Splines
After running the playbook with the ame wizzard some people get stuck at the "Recticulating Splines" screen. <br/>
### First possbible fix:
Check if you have **both the ame wizzard and the playbook on your dekstop**. If not, please stop the ame wizzard with taskmanager, move both the wizzard and playbook to your desktop and try again.

### Second possible fix is to:

Open Task Manager.

Kill The curl executable,

Kill powershell,

Kill Windows Command Processor,

Progress should start again
