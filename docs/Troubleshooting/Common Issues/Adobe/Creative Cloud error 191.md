# Creative Cloud error 191

Since Adobe Creative Cloud is an app that runs on the UWP, it needs services that you might have turned off using one of the AtlasOS scripts.

One of the most common reasons why Creative Cloud users get error 191 is that they have turned off the Microsoft Store. When you turn off the Microsoft Store, you turn off services that most UWP apps use. So, turn on the Microsoft Store and then try again to run Creative Cloud.
