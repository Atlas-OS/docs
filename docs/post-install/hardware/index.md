# :material-memory: Getting Started with Hardware

This section contains hardware-focused post-installation guidance to help you get the most out of your system after installing AtlasOS. Topics include memory overclocking (XMP/DOCP), Resizable BAR, and safely updating your BIOS/UEFI.

Quick links:

- [:material-flash:auto: Enabling XMP/DOCP](enabling-xmp-or-docp.md) — How to enable and validate XMP or DOCP safely.
- [:material-chip: Resizable BAR](resizable-bar.md) — What Resizable BAR is and how to enable it for supported systems.
- [:material-system-update: Updating BIOS/UEFI](updating-the-bios.md) — Best practices for updating firmware safely.

If you're unsure where to start, follow the order above: enable XMP/DOCP if you need memory speed, then check Resizable BAR if you have a supported GPU/motherboard, and update BIOS only when necessary and after backing up important data.
