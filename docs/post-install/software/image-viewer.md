# :material-image: Image Viewer

## qView

qView is an open source image viewer with the goal to be as minimalistic as possible. It is incredibly lightweight and offers a clean and minimal UI. If you just want to view images and don't need any extra features, qView is the best choice.

`winget install -e --id jurplel.qView`

## IrfanView

IrfanView is a lightweight image viewer that is easy to use while still offering plenty of features for more advanced users, which can be expanded even further by a variety of plugins. If you want to not just view but also edit images, IrfanView is perfect.

`winget install -e --id IrfanSkiljan.IrfanView`

## Nomacs (Preview)

Nomacs is a simple yet powerful open source image viewer used for the viewing and basic editing of images. However, unlike qView and IrfanView, the latest official release is very outdated, which is why we recommend using the latest preview.

## Microsoft Photos

Microsoft Photos is an image viewer made by Microsoft and installed by default on AtlasOS. It has a modern UI and features integrations with OneDrive and iCloud. However, unlike the previosly listed options, it does not support all codecs by default so you may have to download additional codec extensions from the Microsoft Store.
