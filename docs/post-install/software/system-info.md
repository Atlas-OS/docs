# :material-information: System Information

System information tools provide you with information about your system, such as temperatures, CPU usage, RAM usage, and more. This information can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues on your system. There are various system information software choices available, so we'll break it down for you.

### Task Manager

The Task Manager is a pre-installed app in Windows that enables you to monitor your system's performance. It helps track CPU usage, RAM usage, and other relevant system information. Moreover, it is an effective tool for troubleshooting and identifying system issues. Although it is the default option for system information software, it may not provide as much data as you require, such as temperatures.

## HWiNFO

HWiNFO is a system information software that provides you with an in-depth analysis of your computer's vitals. It allows you to monitor various aspects of your system, such as temperature, CPU usage, and RAM usage, among others. HWiNFO is a more advanced alternative to the Task Manager, which provides a more comprehensive overview of your system performance, and it is also more lightweight. Its high degree of customization means that you can tailor it to your specific needs, making it a versatile tool that can be used in many different ways.
