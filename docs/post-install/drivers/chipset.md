# :octicons-cpu-16: Installing Chipset Drivers

We recommend installing chipset drivers, especially if you're not getting the performance you were expecting.

Specifically, for newer generations of CPUs, updating your chipset can improve performance.

We're going to be using your **motherboard manufacturer** page to source the chipset drivers, as these are tested to work for your motherboard and aren't generic.

1. Download [HWiNFO to find your motherboard model](https://www.hwinfo.com/)
    1. When you open the application, click start, and it will show you your motherboard model along with other information about your computer.
1. Use Google and search for "*your motherboard model* support" and you will find the support page which lists manuals, drivers, BIOS updates and other information.
1. Find and download your chipset driver from this website.
1. Open and install the driver and you're finished.

*In case you can't find your chipset driver from your motherboard manufacturer, we have a guide for installing the generic chipset from your CPU manufacturer.*

**Only follow these steps when you have tried the steps above.**

=== "AMD"
    1. Open [TechPowerUp's AMD Chipset](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/amd-ryzen-chipset-drivers/) and click the download button.
        1. In case these don't work for you, you can also use [AMD's Official Website](https://www.amd.com/en/support), however, TechPowerUp makes the download experience easier for non-technical users.
    1. Open the executable, and complete the install process.
    1. Your chipset driver is now installed!

=== "Intel"
    1. Open [Intel's Official Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19347/chipset-inf-utility.html) and click the download button.
    1. Open the executable, and complete the install process.
    1. Your chipset driver is now installed!
