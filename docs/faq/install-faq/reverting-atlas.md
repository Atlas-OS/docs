# :material-emoticon-cry: Reverting Atlas

As Atlas disables the 'Reset this PC' feature due to its unreliability and not being a full reinstall of Windows, some users are unsure how to get back to stock Windows.

This page details how to reinstall from Atlas to stock Windows fully, which uninstalls Atlas.

## :material-handshake: Before uninstalling

If you're on an [outdated version of Atlas](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/releases), we unfortunately can't help. Otherwise, we can help you if you're experiencing issues on the latest version. See the below:

- [:material-github: Atlas' GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/discussions)

### If you're still having problems...

We're constantly improving Atlas, so although you're uninstalling now, we hope to see your problem solved in the future. :slight_smile:

Please consider reporting your problem on the [Atlas GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues) so we can fix it.
Alternatively, give feedback in our GitHub Discussions or Discord, as mentioned earlier.
