# :material-disc: Where is the Atlas ISO file?

**Atlas doesn't have an modified ISO file for users to download directly.**

Distributing ISO files violates Microsoft's terms and poses **major safety risks** due to there being no easy way to verify modified third-party ISOs aren't malicious.

> "For software downloads, unless expressly permitted in the accompanying License Terms or End-User License Agreement (EULA), Microsoft does not allow redistribution. You may link to the download page, but not directly to the download, from your product or website."

## How does Atlas work then?

To ensure compliance and safety, you get Atlas by using [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/), which modifies a stock Windows ISO and get you Atlas (or modify Windows on a new live installation, applying configurations like an ISO file). We recommend reading our [installation guide](../../getting-started/index.md) to install Atlas using this system.

## What does the ISO downloader do?

The [ISO downloader in our documentation](../../getting-started/install/install-playbook.md#1-download-an-iso) downloads unmodified ISOs directly from Microsoft's servers. They are there for your convenience.
