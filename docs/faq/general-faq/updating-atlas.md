Keeping your AtlasOS installation current ensures you benefit from the latest features, security updates, and compatibility improvements. 

You can find out which version you have by following the steps in the [Checking Your AtlasOS Version guide](./checking-atlas-version.md).

## What if I'm on an older, unsupported version (v0.3.x and below)?

We understand it can be frustrating to be on an older version. Unfortunately, versions v0.3.x and earlier don't support direct updates to newer Atlas releases.

To ensure you have the best and most secure experience, we **strongly** recommend [reinstalling Windows and then install the newest version of AtlasOS.](../../getting-started/index.md) This is the best way to get all the current benefits.

We know reinstalling can be a bit of work, but it's the safest path forward from these older versions.
