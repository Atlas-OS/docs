# :material-database-arrow-down-outline: Installing AtlasOS, Fresh Install & Data Loss

Many users ask if they need to perform a fresh Windows installation or if their personal data will be lost when applying AtlasOS. Here's a breakdown:

## :material-help-circle-outline: Do I need to reinstall Windows?

**Yes, a fresh/clean installation of Windows is required for a stable and functional AtlasOS experience.**

Attempting to apply AtlasOS on an existing, non-fresh Windows installation **will cause system instability, failed optimizations, broken features, and leave your system in an unsupported state.** It is not a viable alternative to a clean install.

For a working and supported AtlasOS system, you **must**:
1. Perform a clean installation of a compatible Windows version.
2. Apply the Atlas playbook immediately after the Windows setup.

## :material-file-document-outline: Will I lose my personal files and data?

**No.** Applying AtlasOS **does not** intentionally delete your personal files, documents, photos, games, or other user data stored on your drives. The process focuses on modifying Windows system settings, services, and components.

However, some Windows features or built-in apps that Atlas removes might be associated with specific data *within those apps*. If you rely heavily on a feature Atlas removes, ensure you have alternatives or backups for that specific data.

## :material-microsoft-windows: Do I need Windows installed first?

**Yes.** AtlasOS is a modification applied on top of Windows; it is **not** a standalone operating system.

If you are asking this question, it means you have **not** read or followed the **official Atlas Installation Guide**. Following this guide precisely is **mandatory** for a successful and supported installation. It covers all prerequisites, including the requirement to have a compatible version of Windows installed first.

**Do not proceed further without consulting the guide:**
