# :material-backup-restore: Resetting or Reinstalling AtlasOS

A common question is how to "reset" a PC running AtlasOS, perhaps to start fresh or fix persistent issues. It's crucial to understand that using the standard Windows "Reset this PC" feature is **not the correct method and will likely cause problems.**

## :material-alert-circle-outline: Why Standard Windows Reset Fails

AtlasOS makes deep changes to the standard Windows installation. Because of these modifications, the built-in **"Reset this PC" feature does not work correctly** with AtlasOS. It is designed for standard Windows systems and cannot handle the changes Atlas applies.

Attempting to use "Reset this PC" will likely fail or leave your system in a broken, inconsistent, and unsupported state.

**Do NOT use the standard Windows "Reset this PC" option.**

## :material-tools: The Correct Way to "Reset" or Reinstall AtlasOS

If you want to start fresh with AtlasOS (effectively "resetting" your Atlas installation), the **only supported and recommended method** is to perform a clean installation following the official Atlas Installation Guide.

**Before you begin, make sure to back up any important personal data**, as this process involves reinstalling Windows and will wipe your system drive.

**Follow the official Installation Guide for detailed steps:**
