**Yes, the Microsoft Store works seamlessly with AtlasOS right from the start.**

If you encounter any issues with the Microsoft Store on AtlasOS, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Open the **Command Prompt** (CMD) with **Administrator Privileges**. You can do this by searching for 'CMD' in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting 'Run as administrator'.
2. In the Command Prompt, type `wsreset.exe` and press Enter. This command resets the Microsoft Store without changing your settings or apps.
3. Try opening the Microsoft Store again.
